\begin{abstract}
  Before and during a surgery, it is important for medical personnel to have a
    good understanding of the anatomy of a patient. A better understanding can
    lead to a less invasive surgery with less risk of implications.
  The goal of this project is to create a better way for medical personnel to inspect 3D models, making surgeries easier and safer.
\end{abstract}

\section{introduction}


\subsection{introduction}

When a hospital recieves an injured patient that needs surgery, a CT scan is
performed. The CT images are displayed as a 3D model on a computer. This helps
the medical personnel plan the surgery by visualising bone mass or other tissue. If a surgeon has a good understanding of a problem, it can be possible to perform a surgery that has less risk of complications or requires less resources.


The problem with visualising the model in 2D the limited understanding of what
the Bone/tissue actually looks like, because of the lack of scale and depth. A
possible solution is visualising the model in Augumented Reality or Virtual
Reality to give medical personnel a good feel for what the problem actually looks like. 

\section{ background } 

\subsection{ existing solutions}

\subsubsection{existing VR viewers}
There exists several alternatives to viewing a medical data in VR, here are some of the alternatives.

Medical Holodeck \cite{holodeck} is made for surgeons to plan surgeries and education.

An Augumented reality viewer called Dicom Director also exists, but is not yet approved for clinical use. \cite{dicomdirector} 

Most current solutions are closed source premium services targeted at enterprise/medical institutions. Many of them are not yet approved for clinical use, and current solutions are difficult to use for people not used to Virtual Reality \emph{cite needed}


Some free general purpose VR viewers for 3D models also exist, but I have not found any with features related to medical use, collaboration or plannning.

A study in visualising Patient data with VR \cite{vertemati_virtual_2019} implemented a VR viewer for DICOM data and tried to measure anatomical uderstanding compared to 2D images. The study did not investigate the efficiency of the planning phase (loading the model into the software took 1 hour), and it did not do a comparison to 3D printing.

\subsubsection { 3D printing }

An alternative to digital representation is to print the 3d model to inspect it physically \cite{virtualplanningand3dprinting}. This has many advantages, such as the surgeon being able to physically hold the bodypart, measure the model, try out equipment and practice with it.
The biggest drawback to 3D printing is that the printing process can take more than 24 hours depending on the model, which in some cases is too long. Another drawback is not having any digital tools such as transparency, displaying cross sections or being able to alter the model in any way. Having a physical model in plastic also means it needs support structures, which can get in the way or create a inaccurate representation of the fracture.

A possible future usecase for this project is taking a quick look at a model in VR, and then deciding if a printed model is necessary, potentially saving time and resources.

\subsubsection {2D viewer}

There exists a wide range of computer programs to inspect CT images as 3D models, using the computer to interact with the model.
The current solution used by Helse Vest is materialise \cite{materialise}. Using a 2D viewer is fast and simple, but lacks the depth and scale of VR.


\section{Research Questions}
VR has many potential benefits, and it is possible that the surgery planning
process can use some of these. As the users are already looking at 3d models in
2d screens, visualising in VR could improve the surgeons overview and improve the patients safety. The entire planning process could also be more effective, by removing or reducing the need for 3D printed models, especially in cases with limited time. Therefore the possible research questions are as follows:

Can VR technology improve surgery planning by making the process safer or more effective?
Can VR technology give some of the same benefits as 3D printing gives today at a lower cost?


\section{Expected Results}
To test the theory, this thesis will include developing a VR/AR application and
doing qualitative testing on cases with relevant personnel.
The final application will be tested on medical personnel to investigate the impact on the users anatomical understanding, how it effects the surgery and the efficiency of the planning process.

\section{Research Method}
Firstly, a prototype Vr viewer will be created with the help of related
open-source frameworks/software and guidance from medical personnel.

To answer the research question, it is necessary to somehow measure the
performance of the final application. This thesis will use qualitative methods
by interviewing related personnel to investigate the performance including anatomical understanding, cooperation, and the effectiveness of the planning process.
