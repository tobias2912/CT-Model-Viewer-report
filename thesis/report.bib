	abstract = {PURPOSE: The technology of 3D printing (3DP) exists for quite some time, but it is still not utilized to its full potential in the field of orthopaedics and traumatology, such as underestimating its worth in virtual preoperative planning (VPP) and designing various models, templates, and jigs. It can be a significant tool in the reduction of surgical morbidity and better surgical outcome avoiding various associated complications.
METHODS: An observational study was done including 91 cases of complex trauma presented in our institution requiring operative fixation. Virtual preoperative planning and 3DP were used in the management of these fractures. Surgeons managing these cases were given a set of questionnaire and responses were recorded and assessed as a quantitative data.
RESULTS: In all the 91 cases, where VPP and 3DP were used, the surgeons were satisfied with the outcome which they got intraoperatively and postoperatively. Surgical time was reduced, with a better outcome. Three dimensional models of complex fracture were helpful in understanding the anatomy and sketching out the plans for optimum reduction and fixation. The average score of the questionnaire was 4.5, out of a maximum of 6, suggesting a positive role of 3DP in orthopaedics.
CONCLUSION: 3DP is useful in complex trauma management by accurate reduction and placement of implants, reduction of surgical time and with a better outcome. Although there is an initial learning curve to understand and execute the VPP and 3DP, these become easier with practice and experience.},

	abstract = {Introduction. With the availability of low-cost head-mounted displays (HMDs), virtual reality environments (VREs) are increasingly being used in medicine for teaching and clinical purposes. Our aim was to develop an interactive, user-friendly VRE for tridimensional visualization of patient-specific organs, establishing a workflow to transfer 3-dimensional (3D) models from imaging datasets to our immersive VRE. Materials and Methods. This original VRE model was built using open-source software and a mobile HMD, Samsung Gear VR. For its validation, we enrolled 33 volunteers: morphologists (n = 11), trainee surgeons (n = 15), and expert surgeons (n = 7). They tried our VRE and then filled in an original 5-point Likert-type scale 6-item questionnaire, considering the following parameters: ease of use, anatomy comprehension compared with 2D radiological imaging, explanation of anatomical variations, explanation of surgical procedures, preoperative planning, and experience of gastrointestinal/neurological disorders. Results in the 3 groups were statistically compared using analysis of variance. Results. Using cross-sectional medical imaging, the developed VRE allowed to visualize a 3D patient-specific abdominal scene in 1 hour. Overall, the 6 items were evaluated positively by all groups; only anatomy comprehension was statistically significant different among the 3 groups. Conclusions. Our approach, based on open-source software and mobile hardware, proved to be a valid and well-appreciated system to visualize 3D patient-specific models, paving the way for a potential new tool for teaching and preoperative planning.},

	abstract = {Surgical planning software is a key component in the treatment of tumor diseases. However, desktop-based systems provide only limited visualization and interaction opportunities. Moreover, collaborative planning among members of a surgical team is only possible to a limited extent. In this work, a collaborative virtual reality (VR) environment to assist liver surgeons in tumor surgery planning is presented. Our aim is to improve virtual resection planning between surgeons in a remote or co-located environment. The system allows surgeons to define and adjust virtual resections on patient-specific organ 3D surfaces and 2D image slices. Changes on both modalities are synchronized, which will enable surgeons to iterate and refine the resection surfaces quickly. In addition, a real-time risk map visualization is presented that displays safety margins around tumors. An evaluation performed by liver surgeons provides information on potential benefits, such as the possibility to visualize complex cases and assessing the safety-critical areas, applicability, and limitations for further improvement.},
